This hybrid approach maximizes revenue opportunities while serving diverse customer needs.

❌ **Myth**: Brokers are just middlemen
✅ **Reality**: Provide valuable market expertise

❌ **Myth**: You need experience to start
✅ **Reality**: Both can be learned with training

## Making the Choice

### For Shippers:
Consider your needs:
- Domestic only? → Broker

- Both? → 3PL with both services

### For Career Seekers:
Consider your goals:
- Quick start? → Broker

## Industry Trends 2026
