### ⚠️ Warning Signs

## Step-by-Step Vetting Process

### Step 1: Initial Screening (2 minutes)
**Check FMCSA Snapshot**:
```
safer.fmcsa.dot.gov
Enter MC number
Verify:
- Active authority
- Operating since: [Date]
- Insurance on file: Yes/No
- Safety rating: Satisfactory/None
```

### Step 2: Deep Dive (5 minutes)

**Carrier 411 Check**:
- Days to pay: Under 30 ideal
- Credit score: 70+ good
- Fraud reports: None
- References: 10+ positive

**Google Search**:
```
"[Carrier Name]" + fraud
"[MC Number]" + "double broker"
"[Company Name]" + complaints
```

### Step 3: Insurance Verification (3 minutes)
1. Call insurance company directly
2. Verify policy numbers match
3. Confirm coverage amounts
4. Add as certificate holder

**Script for Insurance Company**:
"I need to verify coverage for [Carrier Name], MC [Number]. Policy number [Number]. Can you confirm $1M auto liability and $100K cargo coverage?"

### Step 4: Reference Calls (10 minutes)

**Questions to Ask**:
1. "How long have you worked with them?"
2. "Any service failures or claims?"
3. "Would you use them again?"
4. "Any concerns I should know about?"

## Double Brokering Detection

### How It Works
1. Carrier accepts your load
2. Posts it on load board
3. Another carrier hauls it
4. You lose control/visibility

### Prevention Tactics
**In Rate Confirmation**:
"Carrier agrees not to re-broker this load. Violation results in immediate termination and legal action."

**Monitoring Methods**:
- Track pickup confirmation
- Verify driver name/number
- Check truck numbers
- GPS tracking validation
- Random check calls

### Detection Signs
- Different driver than reported
- Unknown truck at pickup
- Carrier unreachable after pickup
- Tracking shows wrong vehicle
- Driver doesn't know original carrier

## Building Your Carrier Network

### Preferred Carrier Criteria
**Tier 1 (Premium)**:
- 100+ loads completed
- Zero service failures
- Under 24-hour payment terms
- Dedicated capacity

**Tier 2 (Reliable)**:
- 25+ loads completed
- Less than 2% service failures
- Standard payment terms
- Good communication

**Tier 3 (Approved)**:
- Passed vetting
- 5+ loads completed
- Building history
- Monitor closely

## Carrier Fraud Schemes

### Common Scams

**Identity Theft**:
- Steals legitimate MC number
- Changes contact information
- Picks up load
- Disappears with freight

**Prevention**: Always call number on FMCSA

**Hostage Loads**:
- Picks up freight
- Demands more money
- Threatens abandonment
- Extortion tactics

**Prevention**: Clear contracts, LoadVoice recordings

**Phantom Capacity**:
- Claims available trucks
- Accepts multiple loads
- Can't cover any
- Service failures

**Prevention**: Verify equipment, references

## Regional Vetting Considerations

### High-Risk Areas
**Southern Border**: Higher fraud risk
**Port Cities**: Cargo theft concerns
**Major Metros**: More sophisticated fraud

### Safe Zones
**Midwest**: Generally reliable
**Rural Areas**: Stable carriers
**Established Lanes**: Known operators

## Legal Protection

### Contract Language
```
"Carrier warrants exclusive possession and control
of freight from pickup to delivery. Any unauthorized
transfer, double brokering, or co-brokering voids
this agreement and carrier assumes all liability."
```

### Documentation Requirements
