# The Hidden Time Drain in Freight Brokerage

Every freight broker knows the feeling: you just finished a productive call with a carrier, secured a great rate, but now you need to spend the next 15 minutes documenting everything. Multiply that by 50+ calls per week, and you're losing an entire workday just to documentation.

## The 10 Time-Saving Features

### 1. **Instant Call Transcription** (Saves 3 hours/week)
No more replaying calls or deciphering handwritten notes. LoadVoice transcribes every word with 98% accuracy, making every conversation instantly searchable.

### 2. **Automatic Data Extraction** (Saves 2.5 hours/week)
Our AI extracts all critical information automatically:
- Pickup/delivery locations
- Dates and times
- Rates and equipment types
- Carrier MC numbers
- Contact information

### 3. **One-Click Rate Confirmations** (Saves 1.5 hours/week)
Generate professional rate confirmations in seconds, not minutes. All data is pre-populated from the call.

### 4. **Smart Search Across All Calls** (Saves 1 hour/week)
Find that carrier who quoted you $2.50/mile for Dallas to Chicago last month in seconds, not hours.

LoadVoice pushes extracted data directly to your CRM, eliminating double data entry.

### 6. **Email Templates with Smart Fields** (Saves 45 minutes/week)
Create follow-up emails with all call details auto-filled. Just review and send.

### 8. **Compliance Documentation** (Saves 30 minutes/week)
Automatic recording disclosures and audit trails keep you compliant without extra effort.

### 9. **Quick Call Summaries** (Saves 30 minutes/week)
Get AI-generated summaries of long calls in bullet points - perfect for quick reviews.
