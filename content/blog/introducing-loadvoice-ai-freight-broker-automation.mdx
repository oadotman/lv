# Transforming Freight Brokerage with AI

The freight brokerage industry processes millions of phone calls daily. Each call contains critical data - rates, pickup locations, delivery times, carrier details - that needs to be captured accurately and entered into multiple systems. Until now, this has been a manual, time-consuming process.

## The Problem We're Solving

Freight brokers spend **12-15 minutes** documenting each carrier call:
- Taking notes during the call
- Transcribing details afterward
- Entering data into TMS/CRM systems
- Creating rate confirmations
- Following up on missing information

For a typical broker handling 50 calls per week, that's **10+ hours** spent on documentation alone.

## Enter LoadVoice

### 🧠 AI Transcription

### 📊 Intelligent Data Extraction
Using GPT-4, LoadVoice automatically extracts:
- Origin and destination locations
- Pickup and delivery dates/times
