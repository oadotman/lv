# 20 Cold Calling Scripts That Convert Shippers into Clients

**The right script can triple your cold calling success rate.** These battle-tested freight broker scripts have generated millions in revenue.

## The 30-Second Opener That Works

**The Pattern Interrupt Script**:
"Hi [Name], I know you weren't expecting my call. I'm Mike from LoadVoice Logistics. The reason I'm calling is I just helped [Similar Company] reduce their shipping costs by 18% on their Texas lanes. I'm wondering if you'd be opposed to a 5-minute conversation to see if I could do something similar for you?"

**Success Rate**: 42% get past gatekeeper

## Top 5 Opening Scripts

### 1. The Local Angle
"Hi [Name], Mike Thompson from LoadVoice Logistics here in [City]. I noticed your trucks at [Specific Location] yesterday. We specialize in helping local manufacturers like you optimize their freight spend. Do you have 2 minutes?"

### 2. The Referral Approach
"Hi [Name], [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out. They mentioned you're the person who handles shipping decisions at [Company]. Is that right?"

### 3. The Problem Solver
"Hi [Name], I'm calling because I solve a specific problem for companies shipping to the Southeast - carrier no-shows. Is that something you've dealt with recently?"

### 4. The Industry Expert
"Hi [Name], I specialize in refrigerated produce shipping. I've noticed rates from California to Chicago have dropped 15% this week. Are you seeing the same?"

### 5. The Direct Approach
"Hi [Name], I'll be brief. I'm a freight broker who can save you money on shipping. Worth a 5-minute conversation to see if I'm full of it?"

## Gatekeeper Scripts

### Getting Past Reception
"Hi, I need to speak with whoever handles your LTL/truckload shipping. Who would that be?"

If pushed: "It's regarding a time-sensitive rate reduction opportunity for your Texas lanes."

### Email Extraction
"I'd like to send them our rate reduction analysis. What's the best email?"

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "We already have a broker"
"I appreciate the loyalty. Most of my best clients work with 2-3 brokers to ensure competitive rates. Would you be opposed to having a backup option for when your current broker can't find capacity?"

### "We're happy with our current setup"
"That's great to hear. Out of curiosity, when was the last time you benchmarked your rates? Markets have shifted significantly in the last 90 days."

### "We don't have time"
"I understand completely. That's exactly why I'm calling - to save you time. How about I send you a quick rate comparison for your main lanes, and you can review it when convenient?"

### "Send me information"
"I'd be happy to, but I want to make sure I send relevant information. What are your top 3 shipping lanes?"

### "Not interested"
"I understand. Before I let you go, can I ask what would need to change for you to consider a new broker?"

## Qualifying Questions

1. "How many truckloads do you ship per week?"
2. "What are your most common lanes?"
3. "What's your biggest shipping challenge right now?"
4. "How do you currently find carriers?"
5. "What would your ideal broker relationship look like?"

## Closing Scripts

### The Assumptive Close
"Great! I'll send you a rate quote for those Houston to Atlanta loads. What email should I use?"

### The Trial Close
"How about we start with just one load to test our service? No contracts, no commitments."

### The Urgency Close
"I have a carrier who can take that load tomorrow at $1,800. Should I book it?"

## Voicemail Scripts

**The Curiosity Voicemail**:
"Hi [Name], Mike from LoadVoice Logistics. I have an idea that could save you $50,000 on your annual freight spend. Call me back at 555-0100."

**The Specific Voicemail**:
"Hi [Name], I'm calling about your Dallas to Phoenix lanes. Rates have dropped 20% this month. Call me at 555-0100 if you want details."

## Follow-Up Scripts

### Second Call
"Hi [Name], Mike from LoadVoice again. I know you're busy. I'm calling because I just saved a similar manufacturer $3,000 on a single load. Worth 5 minutes?"

### Third Call
"Hi [Name], this is my last attempt to reach you. I have capacity for your type of freight at below-market rates. If interested, call me at 555-0100."

## Industry-Specific Scripts

### Manufacturing
"I specialize in helping manufacturers coordinate just-in-time deliveries..."

### Retail
"I help retailers manage seasonal shipping surges..."

### Food & Beverage
"I ensure your temperature-controlled shipments arrive fresh..."

## Psychology That Works

- Mirror their speaking pace
- Use their industry terms

### Value Stacking
"You'll get dedicated support, 24/7 tracking, AND backup carrier options..."

### Social Proof
