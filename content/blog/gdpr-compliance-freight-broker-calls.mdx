# Navigating GDPR in Freight Brokerage

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to any business processing EU citizen data, including freight brokers working with European carriers or shippers. Call recordings contain personal data, making GDPR compliance essential.

## Key GDPR Requirements for Call Recording

### 1. **Lawful Basis for Processing**
LoadVoice operates under "legitimate interests" - documenting business transactions and ensuring service quality. This is the most appropriate basis for B2B freight communications.

### 2. **Transparency and Consent**
- **Automatic Disclosures**: LoadVoice plays state-specific recording disclosures
- **Clear Purpose**: Callers are informed recordings are for business documentation
- **Opt-out Options**: Callers can request calls not be recorded

### 3. **Data Minimization**
LoadVoice only extracts and stores business-relevant information:
- Load details and rates
- Business contact information
- Equipment and commodity data
- No unnecessary personal details

## LoadVoice's GDPR-Compliant Architecture

### Smart Data Retention
```
Audio Files → Deleted after 7 days
Transcriptions → Anonymized after 90 days
Business Data → Retained as per your settings
Personal Data → Minimized and secured
```

### Data Subject Rights
LoadVoice fully supports GDPR's eight fundamental rights:

1. **Right to Access**: Export all data about a specific carrier/contact
2. **Right to Rectification**: Edit incorrect information directly
3. **Right to Erasure**: Delete specific calls or all data for a contact
4. **Right to Restrict Processing**: Pause processing for specific contacts
5. **Right to Data Portability**: Export data in CSV/JSON formats
6. **Right to Object**: Honor opt-out requests immediately
7. **Right to Refuse Automated Decision-making**: Human review always available
8. **Right to Be Informed**: Clear privacy notices and consent flows

## Security Measures

### Encryption Everywhere
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Processing**: Encrypted pipelines for AI processing

### Access Controls
- Role-based permissions
- Multi-factor authentication
- Audit logs for all data access
- Regular security reviews

## Practical Compliance Steps

### For EU-Based Brokers
1. **Update Privacy Policy**: Include LoadVoice processing
2. **Inform Partners**: Notify carriers about call recording
3. **Document Legitimate Interests**: Keep records of why recording is necessary
4. **Appoint DPO**: If processing large volumes of EU data

### For US Brokers with EU Partners
1. **Implement Standard Contractual Clauses**: For data transfers
2. **Respect EU Rights**: Even if not legally required
3. **Maintain Records**: Document all EU data processing

## Data Processing Locations

LoadVoice processes data in secure, compliant locations:
- **Primary Storage**: US-East (Virginia)
- **EU Data**: Can be restricted to EU servers on request
- **No Third Countries**: Data never leaves US/EU without consent

## Compliance Automation Features

### Automatic Anonymization
After 90 days, LoadVoice automatically:
- Removes personal identifiers from transcripts
- Replaces names with role descriptions
- Maintains business data integrity

### Consent Management
- Track consent status per contact
- Automatic consent expiry reminders
- One-click consent renewal workflows

### Data Breach Protocol
In the unlikely event of a breach:
1. **Detection**: 24/7 monitoring systems
2. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
3. **Notification**: Within 72 hours to authorities
4. **User Notification**: Direct communication if high risk
5. **Documentation**: Full breach report and remediation steps
