### Peak Time Tactics

- **Friday afternoon**: Weekend emergency rates

### Search Optimization Tips

**Keywords That Work**:

- Exclude: "Lumper", "TWIC", "Hazmat" (unless certified)

**Filter Hacks**:
- Set radius to 50 miles for hidden gems
- Search destination-first for backhauls
- Use partial matches for equipment ("flat" catches flatbed/stepdeck)

## Integration with LoadVoice
